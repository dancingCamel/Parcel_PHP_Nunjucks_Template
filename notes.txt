install nunjucks and parcel-plugin-nunjucks

PHP files saved as static files and use "parcel-plugin-static-files-copy" package to move across to dist folder. create static folder in root and have php folder in here
Put composer in static folder root

Auto copy dist folder to apache root with module.hot statement in main.js and bash script (copy_dist_to_apache_root.sh)
Use parcel-plugin-shell: npm i parcel-plugin-shell -D

Bash script runs when building, too


Install composer with:
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"

Check sha with
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'c31c1e292ad7be5f49291169c0ac8f683499edddcfd4e42232982d0fd193004208a58ff6f353fde0012d35fdd72bc394') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
but replace the hash with most up-to-date sha (https://composer.github.io/pubkeys.html)

php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
